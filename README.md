# Assignment Directions

### Assignment Goal

In class, you will generate hypotheses about various aspects of habitat structure (e.g. wave exposure and substrate type) that influences species diversity in the intertidal zone. Weâ€™ll then discuss the utility of a range of approaches used by intertidal ecologists to sample species with different characteristics. We will then work together to develop a sampling scheme to assess the diversity and abundance of the species you learned to ID in Assignment #1. Then, on Tuesday morning  we will head into the field and put the sampling plan in to action.

This project involves group work (4 students per group) to write up the project. Field data collected by each group will be pooled to produce a class-wide data set for the analysis. Group project tasks include:

1. Field data collection (on Oct 27th)
2. Data management (entry, quality assurance, and meta-data creation; by Oct 27th)
3. Data analysis & graphing (discuss with your group members when it should be there - suggest by EOD Nov. 01)

### Assignment Submission Items

You will submit the following items:

1. A file containing your summary and analysis `group-summary.md` that includes:
  a. Your hypothesis or question
  b. Summary of data collection/ types of data used (1-2 sentences)
  c. Summary of the analyses you did to answer your question (1-2 sentences)
  d. Results and conclusions (1-2 sentences) with associated graphs and figures
2. A folder called `images` where you save the images you make to `.png` files for the rest of your group to use. 
  - when you create the plots from your data, you can save the plot using the code `ggsave([plot-name], here("./images/[file-name].png)` where the `[plot-name]` and `[file-name]` are what you have chosen to call your ggplot objects and the file you're writing out. 
3. An `RProject` so your code is completely reproducible
4. A knit pdf version of your `group-summary.md` file 

What you will upload as a group in group-summary.md file includes:

1. Your hypothesis or question
2. Summary of data collection/ types of data used (1-2 sentences)
3. Summary of the analyses you did to answer your question (1-2 sentences)
4. Results and conclusions (1-2 sentences) with associated graphs and figures
